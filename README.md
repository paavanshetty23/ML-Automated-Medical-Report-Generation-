# Augmented Skin Conditions Image Dataset

## Overview

The Augmented Skin Conditions Image Dataset is a comprehensive collection of images focusing on six common skin conditions. This dataset is designed to support the development of machine learning models for dermatological image analysis and classification.

## Dataset Details

- **Total Images**: 2,394 JPEG images
- **Categories**: 6 (Acne, Carcinoma, Eczema, Keratosis, Milia, Rosacea)
- **Images per Category**: 399
- **Image Format**: JPEG
- **Image Dimensions**: Variable (min: 111x58, median: 243x360, max: 3504x2336)
